# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image files for the Expo app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1242x2436px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon foreground (1024x1024px recommended)

## Quick Setup

You can generate these assets using:
1. Expo's asset generator: `npx expo install expo-asset`
2. Online tools like https://www.appicon.co/ or https://www.favicon-generator.org/
3. Create simple placeholder images using any image editor

For development, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders until you create proper assets.
